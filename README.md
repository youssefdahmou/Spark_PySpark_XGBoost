# Spark PySpark XGBoost Time Series Prediction

## Overview

This project leverages Apache Spark with PySpark to implement an XGBoost model for time series prediction. The primary goal is to forecast the closing price of a transaction using historical data. XGBoost, a popular machine learning library, is employed for its powerful capabilities in handling time series data and predicting future trends.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes Spark's PySpark framework to preprocess and analyze time series data, and implements an XGBoost model to predict the closing price of transactions. The parallel processing capabilities of Spark enhance the scalability and efficiency of the model on large datasets.

## Dependencies

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- Apache Spark (version 3.4.1)
- PySpark (version 3.4.1)
- XGBoost

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/youssefdahmou/Spark_PySpark_XGBoost.git
    cd spark-xgboost-time-series
    ```
